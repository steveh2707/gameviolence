  <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
  <p>
    To get started, get in a group of four and discuss what you know, or you think you know, about video games and
    violence. Your initial discussion should be based around the following points:
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>examples of violent games you know/play</li>
    <li>the type of violence, i.e. fighting, shooting etc...</li>
    <li>what you feel when playing these violent games</li>
    <li>any real world cases of violence that have been related to video games</li>
    <li>your initial thoughts about the influence of violent games on behaviour.</li>
  </ul>
